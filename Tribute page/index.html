            Marie Curie (1867–1934) was a physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research
            on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person
            to ever win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields — Physics and Chemistry.
            Her discoveries of polonium and radium revolutionized science and medicine, and her
            efforts in World War I helped develop mobile X-ray units.

            Curie's relentless dedication to science opened doors for women in STEM and continues
            to inspire scientists around the world.
